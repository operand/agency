# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to the Agency library!

There are two high level areas where you might want to contribute: examples, or
the core library.

## Adding to the Examples Directory

The [`examples/`](./examples/) directory is intended to be an informal directory
of example implementations, experiments, or ideas.

Feel free to add a folder under the [`examples/`](./examples/) directory with
anything you'd like to share. It's unlikely to be rejected.

Please document it well enough for others to understand and please make an
effort to maintain it if possible. Library maintainers will not be responsible
for maintaining examples, except for the main `demo` application.

The main demo located at [`examples/demo/`](./examples/demo/) is maintained
closely with the core library. Feel free to copy the demo application as a basis
for your own examples or personal work. That is its main purpose.

If you'd like to make significant changes to the main demo (not a simple bug fix
or something trivial), please discuss this with the maintainers.

## Core Library Contributions

Contributions to the core Agency library are encouraged as well, though expect
more scrutiny.

There isn't a complex process aside from opening a PR and having it reviewed by
maintainers, but other than bug fixes or trivial improvements, significant
changes to the core library should be discussed in order to ensure alignment on
design and implementation. If you're unsure, open an issue or discussion first.

A couple informal guidelines for core contributions:

* Tests should be updated or added with any core changes. If you're adding
  functionality there should probably be new tests for it.

* Documentation should be updated or added as needed.
