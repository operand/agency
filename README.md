# `everything`

A fast and minimal foundation for unifying human, AI, and other computing
systems, in python


## What is `everything`?

`everything` defines a common communication and action framework for integrating
AI agents, humans, and traditional computing systems.

`everything` allows you to establish shared environments called "spaces" where
any number of humans, artificial, or other computing systems may equally address
each other as individual "operators" that you may perform "actions" on.

`everything` handles the details of the common messaging protocol and allows
discovering and invoking actions across all parties, automatically handling
things such as reporting exceptions, enforcing access restrictions, and more.

The API accommodates integration with systems as varied as:

- voice assistants
- UI driven applications
- terminal environments
- web applications
- software APIs
- people
- ...
- anything


# Install
> **WARNING:**\
Running `everything` may result in exposing your computer to access by any
connected `Operator` including AI agents. Please understand the risks before
using this software and do not configure it for OS access otherwise.\
\
If you want to enable OS access, to allow for file I/O for example, I HIGHLY
RECOMMEND running your project within a Docker container to prevent direct
access to your host, allowing you to limit the resources and directories that
may be accessed.

**Please note that `everything` is not yet at a stable release or published
to pip but will be soon.**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:operand/everything.git
pip install ./everything
```


# API Overview

`everything` is an implementation of the [Actor
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) intended for integrating AI,
human, and traditional computing systems.

In `everything`, all entities are represented as instances of the class
`Operator`. This includes all humans, software, or AI agents.

The `Operator` class is a base class similar to "Object" in many object-oriented
languages. All operators may expose "actions" which can be invoked by other
operators, by simply defining instance methods on the class.

A `Space` is a subclass of `Operator` and is used to group multiple operators
together.

A space can be thought of as both a collection of operators and a "router"
for their communication. An operator cannot communicate with others until it
is first added to a space.

Since `Space`'s are `Operator`'s themselves, they may be nested, allowing for
namespacing and hierarchical organization of the operators in your
application.

To summarize, the two classes of `Operator` and `Space` together create a simple
API for defining and integrating complex applications that may mix AI, human,
and traditional computing systems.


Let's walk through a thorough example to see how this works in practice.


# Example Walkthrough

> Please note that the example classes used in this walkthrough are implemented
for you to explore and try out, but should be considered "proof of concept"
quality at this time.


## Creating a `Space`

Let's start by instantiating a demo space.

```python
space = Space("DemoSpace")
```

Spaces, like all operators, must be given an `id`. So the line above
instantiates a single space called `"DemoSpace"` that we can now add
operators to.


## Adding an `Operator` to a `Space`

Now, let's add our first operator to the space, a simple transformers library
backed chatbot class named `ChattyAI`. You can browse the source code for
`ChattyAI` [here](./everything/operators/chattyai.py).

```python
space.add(ChattyAI("Chatty", model="EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m"))
```

The line above adds a new `ChattyAI` instance to the space, with the `id` of
`"Chatty"`. It also passes the `model` argument to the constructor, which is
used to initialize the HuggingFace transformers language model.

At this point "Chatty" has a fully qualified `id` of `"Chatty.DemoSpace"`.  This
is because `"Chatty"` is a member of the `"DemoSpace"` space.

This way, spaces establish a namespace for their member operators which can
later be used to address them.


## Defining Actions

Looking at `ChattyAI`'s source code, you'll see that it is a subclass of
`Operator`, and that it exposes a single action called `"say"`.

The `"say"` action is defined as a method on the `ChattyAI` class, using
the following signature:

```python
def _action__say(self, content: str):
    """Use this action to say something to Chatty"""
    ...
```

The prefix `_action__` is used to indicate that this is an action that can be
invoked by other `Operator`'s. The suffix `say` is the name of the action.

This `"say"` action takes a single string argument `content`. This action is
intended to allow other operators to chat with Chatty, as expressed in its
docstring.

When `ChattyAI` receives a `"say"` action, it will generate a response using its
prompt format with the language model, and return the result to the sender.


## Invoking Actions

At the end of the `ChattyAI` `"say"` implementation, we see an example of using
`everything`'s messaging protocol. `ChattyAI` returns a response to the sender
by calling:

```python
...
self._send({
    "to": self._current_message['from'],
    "thoughts": "",
    "action": "say",
    "args": {
      "content": response_content,
    }
})
```

This is a very simple implementation, but it demonstrates the basic idea of how
to invoke an action on another operator.

When an operator receives a message, it invokes the action method specified in
by the `"action"` field of the message, passing the `"args"` to the action
method as keyword arguments.

So here we see that Chatty is invoking the `"say"` action on the sender of
the original message, passing the response as the `"content"` argument.


## The Common Message Schema

In the example above, we see the format that is used when sending actions.

In describing the messaging format, there are two terms that are used similarly:
"action" and "message".

An "action" is the format you use when sending, as seen in the `_send()`
call above. You do not specify your the `"from"` field, as it will be
automatically added when routing.

A "message" then, is a "received action" which includes the additional
`"from"` field containing the sender's fully qualified `id`.

Continuing the example above, the original sender would receive a response
message from Chatty that would look something like:

```python
{
    "from": "Chatty.DemoSpace",
    "to": "Sender.DemoSpace",
    "thoughts": "",
    "action": "say",
    "args": {
      "content": "Whatever Chatty said",
    }
}
```

This is an example of the full message schema that is used for all
messages sent between operators in `everything`.

This format is intended to be simple and extensible enough to support any use
case while remaining human readable.

So when the sending operator receives the above response, it in-turn invokes
their own `"say"` action, for them to process as they choose.

Note that the `"thoughts"` field is defined as a distinct argument for providing
a natural language explanation to accompany any action, but as of this writing
`ChattyAI` does not make use of it.

For more details on the common message schema see
[schema.py](./everything/things/schema.py).


## Access Control

You may have noticed the `@access_policy` decorator used on the `"say"` action in
`ChattyAI`:

```python
@access_policy(ACCESS_PERMITTED)
def _action__say(self, content: str):
    """Use this action to say something to Chatty"""
    ...
```

This is an example of an access control policy. Access control policies are used
to control what actions can be invoked by other operators.

The access policy can currently be one of three values:

- `ACCESS_PERMITTED` - which permits any operator to use that action at
any time
- `ACCESS_DENIED` - which prevents use
- `ACCESS_REQUESTED` - which will prompt the receiving operator for permission
when access is attempted. Access will await approval or denial. If denied, the
sender is notified of the denial.

If `ACCESS_REQUESTED` is used, the receiving operator will be prompted at run
time to approve the action.

If any actions require permission, you must implement the
`_request_permission()` method with the following signature:

```python
def _request_permission(self, proposed_message: MessageSchema) -> bool:
    ...
```

This method is called when an operator attempts to invoke an action that has
been marked as `ACCESS_REQUESTED`. Your method should inspect the
`proposed_message` and return a boolean indicating whether or not to permit the
action.

You can use this approach to protect against dangerous actions being taken. For
example if you allow terminal access, you may want to review commands before
they are invoked.

This implementation of access control is just a start, and further development
of the mechanics is a priority for this project.


## Adding Human Users With the `WebApp` Class

A single chatting AI wouldn't be useful without someone to chat with, so now
let's add humans into the space so that they can chat with "Chatty". To do
this, we'll use the `WebApp` class, which is a subclass of `Space`.

Why is `WebApp` a subclass of `Space` and not `Operator`? This is an
arbitrary choice up to the developer, but the guideline is:

_If you want to include multiple operators as a group, you should create a
`Space` subclass and implement any additional logic necessary to forward
messages to individual operators in the group._

We could implement `WebApp` as a subclass of `Operator`, and create a web
application in a way where the web app would appear as a single operator,
perhaps running it locally, if that fits the use case.

But since a typical web application serves multiple users, it may make sense to
implement it as a `Space` subclass, so that individual users of the web
application can be addressed by other operators using a namespace associated
with the web application, as we'll see below.

So this is _not_ the only way this could be accomplished but is intended as a
complex example to showcase why one might want to define a `Space` subclass to
group operators when it makes sense.


### Examining the `WebApp` Class

The implementation located [here](./everything/spaces/web_app.py) defines a
simple `Flask` based web application that hosts a single page `React` based chat
UI.

The implementation takes some shortcuts, but in it you'll see that we actually
define two classes, one for the web application which extends `Space`, called
`WebApp`, and a second class to represent users of the web app, called
`WebAppUser`.

The `WebAppUser` class is where we define the actions that an individual web app
user may expose to others.

Using the `asyncio` library you'll see that we simply forward messages as-is to
the `React` frontend, and allow the client code to handle rendering and parsing
of input as actions back to the `Flask` application, which in-turn sends them to
their intended receiver in the space.


## Namespacing and Adding the Web Application

Now that we've defined our new `WebApp` class, we can add it to `DemoSpace`
with:

```python
space.add(WebApp("WebApp", port=os.getenv('WEB_APP_PORT')))
```

Whenever any operator is added to a space, its fully qualified `id` becomes
namespaced by the space's `id`.

For example, after running the line above the `WebApp` being an operator as
well, receives an `id` of `"WebApp.DemoSpace"`.

At this point, we have integrated the following operators listed using their
fully qualified `id`'s

- `"DemoSpace"` - The root space
- `"ChattyAI.DemoSpace"` - ChattyAI's fully qualified `id`
- `"WebApp.DemoSpace"` - the root of the `"WebApp"` space


Users of the web application, as they log in or out, may be added dynamically
under the `"WebApp"` namespace allowing them to be addressed with a fully
qualified `id` of, for example `"Dan.WebApp.DemoSpace"`.

_(Note that login/out functionality is not implemented as of this writing.)_


## Adding OS Access with the `Host` class

At this point, we have a system where human users of the web application can
chat with `ChattyAI`, using just a single action called `"say"` that both
`Operator` classes implement.

Now we'll add an operator that exposes many different actions, the
[`Host`](./everything/operators/host.py) class.

```python
space.add(Host("Host"))
```

The `Host` class allows access to the host operating system where the python
application is running. It exposes actions such as `read_file` and
`shell_command` which allow other operators to take actions on the host.

This class is a good example of one with potentially dangerous actions that need
to be accessed with care. You'll notice that all the methods in the `Host` class
have been given the access policy:

```python
@access_policy(ACCESS_REQUESTED)
```

By declaring this access policy, all actions on the host will require a
confirmation from the terminal where the application is being run. This is
thanks to the implementation of `_request_permission()` in the `Host` class.

Note that this implementation of `_request_permission()` is just one
possibility. We could have implemented, for example, a phone notification for a
human to review from anywhere.


## Discovering Actions

At this point, we can demonstrate how discovery works from the perspective of
a human user of the web application.

Once added to a space, each operator may send a `help` message to discover other
operators and actions that are available in the space.

The `WebApp` which hosts a simple chat UI supports a "slash" syntax
summarized here:
```python
/actionname arg1:val1 arg2:val2 ...
```
_(Note that quotes may be used for values that contain spaces)_

So a person using the chat UI can discover available actions with:
```
/help
```
This will broadcast a `help` action to all other operators, who will
individually respond with a list of their available actions. The returned list
of actions from the `Host` operator, would look something like:

```python
[
    {
        "to": "Host.DemoSpace",
        "action": "delete_file",
        "thoughts": "Delete a file",
        "args": {
          "filepath": "str"
        }
    },
    {
        "to": "Host.DemoSpace",
        "action": "list_files",
        "thoughts": "List files in a directory",
        "args": {
          "directory_path": "str"
        }
    },
    ...
]
```

Notice that each action lists the fully qualified `id` of the operator in the
`"to"` field, the docstring of the action's method in the `"thoughts"` field,
and each argument along with its type in the `"args"` field.

So a person using the web app UI can invoke the `list_files` action on
`"Host.DemoSpace"` with the following syntax:

```
/list_files to:Host.DemoSpace directory_path:/app
```

This will send the `list_files` action to the `Host` operator who will (after
being granted permission) return the results back to `"Dan.WebApp.DemoSpace"`
rendering it to the web user interface.

Note the use of the fully qualified `id` of `Host.DemoSpace` used with the `to:`
field


## Broadcast vs Point-to-Point Messaging

If we omit the `to:Host.DemoSpace` portion of the command above, the message will be
broadcast, and any operators who implement a `list_files` action will respond.

This is also how the `/help` command works. If you want to request help from
just a single operator you can use something like:

```
/help to:Host.DemoSpace
```

Note that point-to-point messages (messages that define the `"to"` field) will
result in an error if the action is not defined on the target operator.

Broadcast messages will _not_ return an error, but will silently be ignored by
operators who do not implement the given action.


## Adding an Environment-Aware Agent

Finally we get to the good part!

We'll now add an intelligent agent into this environment and see that it is
easily able to understand and interact with any of the systems or humans we've
connected thus far.

To add the [`DemoAgent`](./everything/operators/demo_agent.py) class to the
environment:
```python
space.add(
    DemoAgent("Demo",
        model="text-davinci-003",
        openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")))
```

Note that the `DemoAgent` class is implemented to use the OpenAI API as a
language model backend.

I recommend using language models on par with GPT-3.5 or better for the best
results with agents.


### The `DemoAgent` Prompt

What makes the `DemoAgent` able to intelligently discover and interact with
others is largely embodied in the `DemoAgent._prompt_head()` method. In it
you'll notice a few key points:

1. The prompt is written from the first person perspective as though it is the
agent's own thoughts. This differs slightly from common practice, which usually
uses the second-person perspective. I do not think this makes a large difference
but was worth mentioning. This is more of a personal preference.

1. I frame the situation clearly and accurately for the agent, telling it enough
about who it is, its goals, and the JSON format that it uses to communicate.

1. I "pretend" that the bottom portion is a terminal application. By signaling a
change in context with the `%%%%% Terminal %%%%%` header, we help make clear to
the language model that this is a distinct section of content with its own text
patterns to continue. I do not believe that this is a crucial technique either,
but it is worth noting.

1. I use the `_message_log_to_list()` method to dynamically insert the previous
conversation up to the current point. See the mixin class `PromptMethods` for
the implementation. There is no summarization used, so the current
implementation will eventually hit the context window after a short time.

1. I insert a fake event at the beginning of the terminal portion of the prompt,
pretending that the agent themself executed the `help` action proactively, and
display the resulting list. This is just a slick way to insert the available
actions while keeping the supposed context of the terminal, and providing a
one-shot example to begin from.

Note that `ChattyAI` uses a more typical prompt, showing that prompt techniques
need not be shared by all agents connected to a space, but can be entirely
unique to each agent.


## Complete Demo Implementation

The following is the full implementation (minus imports) of the above
walkthrough that you can try out on your own. Note that `Space.run()` starts a
thread, so we simply keep the application alive with a while loop.

```python
# demo.py

if __name__ == '__main__':

    space = Space("DemoSpace") 

    space.add(
        WebApp("WebApp", port=os.getenv('WEB_APP_PORT')))

    space.add(
        ChattyAI("Chatty", model="EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m"))

    space.add(
        Host("Host"))

    space.add(
        DemoAgent("Demo",
            model="text-davinci-003",
            openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")))

    space.run()

    # keep alive
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
```

If you run the above python script, after a short boot time you can visit the
web app on the port you specify (`WEB_APP_PORT`) and you should see a simple
chat interface.

The following is a screenshot of a conversation that showcases `DemoAgent`'s
ability to intelligently interact with the other operators in the environment,
including running commands on the host, or chatting with "Chatty".

Note that my messages are broadcasted in the below conversation, which explains
why Chatty responds to each message also. There is an obvious difference in
quality, of course.

I also demonstrate the results of rejecting an action and asking him to use a
different approach.

Behind the scenes, Demo did message Chatty directly, and after I explained my
rejection of the `read_file` action, Demo used the command `wc -l Dockerfile`
which was more appropriate. And the file indeed has 75 lines.

# Hypothetical Examples

The following examples are not implemented, but are presented to give you
additional ideas for integrations that `everything` could be support.

```python
Space([

    # Integrate access to a remote server
    Server("Ubuntu",
        ip="192.168.1.100"),

    # Add a voice assistant interface
    VoiceAssistant("VoiceyAI")

    # Use email to send/receive messages from others
    Email("Dan", address="dan@example.com"),

    # Integrate other ML services, like for images
    DiffusionModel("ImageAI"),

    # Horizontal scaling could be achieved by simply duplicating operators
    # (notice we repeat the last one)
    DiffusionModel("ImageAI"),

    # Existing AI agents may integrate as well
    LangChainAgent("MyLangChainAgent"))

    # Development related tasks like model training may also be accomplished.
    # You would only need to add one new `Operator` that reads a data set and
    # sends it as messages to the `Operator` class used for inference, provided
    # the underlying model is first switched to a training mode. For example:
    DatasetTrainer("DatasetTrainer",
      trainee: "ChattyAIInTraining"
    )
    ChattyAI("ChattyAIInTraining",
      training_mode: True,
      ...
    )

    # Network and share your LMs and Agents with others
    RemoteAgent("AgentHelperDude",
      url: "https://agent.helper.dude:2023",
      ...
    )

    # You get the idea...
    AnySystemOrPersonOrFunctionAtAllThatYouWantToShareChannel(
      "Guest",
      ...
    )

]).create()
```


# FAQ

## How does `everything` compare to agent libraries like LangChain?

Though you could entirely create a simple agent using only the primitives in
`everything` (see [`DemoAgent`](./everything/operators/demo_agent.py)), it is
not intended to be a full-fledged agent toolset. It can be thought of as more of
an "agent integration framework".

Projects like LangChain, AutoGPT and others are exploring how to create
purpose-built agents that solve diverse problems using tools.

`everything` is concerned with creating a safe and dynamic _environment_ for
these types of agents to work, where they can freely discover and communicate
with the tools, each other, and any humans available in their environment.

`everything` provides a simple means for defining actions, callbacks, and
access policies that you can use to monitor and ensure safety for the systems
you expose to your agents.

A central part of the design is that humans and other systems can easily
integrate as well, using a simple common format for messages. You can even use
`everything` to set up a basic chat room to use with friends or other systems
and not use agents at all!

An additional benefit of its general design is that `everything` may also
simplify some agent development workflows. See the hypothetical examples above.

So, `everything` is a more general framework intended to support agent
development and to ultimately enable agents to safely integrate with anything,
in any way imaginable.

priorities.


## Priorities
- **Speed**:
  Performance is always a concern. If it's not performant, it's not practical.
  Currently the limitations of pythong multi-threading are a bottleneck 
- **Access Control and Safety**:
  Designing an effective access control solution for AI integrated systems is a
  fundamental problem to solve in order to ensure safety. I believe I've
  included a sane first attempt at such a pattern, but further exploration will
  be a focus of this project.
- **Compatibility and Usability**:
  In general, I believe this is a fair start in defining a set of patterns for
  creating AI integrated systems. I intend to continually improve the API,
  protocol, and other aspects of its design as needed based on feedback from
  real world use. [So please let me
  know!](https://github.com/operand/everything/issues)
- **Documentation**:
  I hope to ensure documentation is kept small, accurate and up to date. This
  readme serves as a start.
