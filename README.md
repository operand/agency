# Summary

`agency` defines a common communication and action framework for creating AI
agent integrated applications.

The library provides a low-level means for connecting agents, systems, and human
users by defining actions, callbacks, and access policies that you can use to
monitor, control, and interact with your agents.

`agency` handles the details of the common messaging system and allows
discovering and invoking actions across parties, automatically handling things
such as reporting exceptions, enforcing access restrictions, and more.

`agency`'s purpose is to support agent development and integration by allowing
you to create dynamic environments for your agents to freely work in a safe and
controllable way, and to leave all other details up to you.

Set your agents free (or just as much as you want) with `agency`!


## Features

### Low-Level API Flexibility
  * Straightforward class/method based agent and action definition
  * Supports defining single process applications or networked agent systems
  using AMQP

# API Overview

`agency` is an implementation of the [Actor
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for building AI agent
integrated systems.

In `agency`, all entities are represented as instances of the `Agent` class.
This includes all humans, software, and AI-driven agents that may communicate as
part of your application.

All agents may expose "actions" that other agents can discover and invoke at run
time. An example of a simple agent implemention could be:

```python
class CalculatorAgent(Agent):
  def _action__add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

This defines an agent with a single action: `"add"`. Other agents will be able
to call this method by sending a message to an instance of `CalculatorAgent` and
specifying the `"add"` action.

```python
other_agent._send({
  'to': 'CalcAgent',
  'thoughts': 'Optionally explain here',
  'action': 'add',
  'args': {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
  },
})
```

Actions must also specify an access policy, allowing you to control access for
safety. For example:

```python
  @access_policy(ACCESS_PERMITTED) # This allows the action at any time
  def _action__add(a, b):
    ...
```

You can also define before/after and permission callbacks for various purposes:

```python
class CalculatorAgent(Agent):
  ...
  def _before_action(self, original_message: dict):
    # Called before any action is attempted

  def _after_action(self, original_message: dict, return_value: str, error: str):
    # Called after any action is attempted

  def _request_permission(self, proposed_message: dict) -> bool:
    # Called before an ACCESS_REQUESTED action is attempted for run-time review
```

A `Space` is how you connect your agents together. An agent cannot communicate
with others until it is added to a common "space".

There are two included `Space` implementations to choose from:
* `NativeSpace` - which connects agents within the same python process
* `AMQPSpace` - which connects agents across processes and systems using an AMQP
  server like RabbitMQ.

Here is an example of creating a `NativeSpace` and adding two agents to it.

```python
space = NativeSpace()
space.add(CalculatorAgent("CalcAgent"))
space.add(AIAgent("AIAgent"))
# The agents above can now communicate
```

These are just some of the main `agency` features. For more detailed information
please see [the docs directory](./docs/).


# Install

```sh
pip install agency
```
or
```sh
poetry add agency
```


# Running the Demo Application

To run the demo, please follow the directions at
[examples/demo](./examples/demo/).

After a short boot time you can visit the web app at `http://localhost:8080` and
you should see a simple chat interface. The following is a screenshot of a
conversation that demonstrates multiple agents intelligently interacting and
following orders.

There are two OpenAI based agents: `"FunctionAI"` and `"CompletionAI"`, named
for the API's they use, and `"Chatty"` a simple chat agent who uses a small
local transformers based model for demonstration.

The screenshot also demonstrates the results of rejecting an action and
directing an agent to use a different approach in real time. After I explained
my rejection of the `read_file` action (which happened behind the scenes on the
terminal), `"FunctionAI"` appropriately used the `shell_command` action with `wc
-l Dockerfile`.

# FAQ

## How does `agency` compare to agent libraries like LangChain?

Though you could entirely create a simple agent using only the primitives in
`agency` (see [`examples/demo/agents/`](./examples/demo/agents/)), it is not
intended to be a full-fledged agent toolset.

Projects like LangChain and others are exploring how to create purpose-built
agents that solve diverse problems using tools. `agency` is focused on the
problems surrounding agent/tool integration, such as observability and access
control.

More likely, you would use LangChain and other libraries for defining agent
behavior and rely on `agency` to provide the connective layer for bringing
agents and other systems together.

So in comparison, `agency` is a smaller but more general purpose application
framework compared to libraries like LangChain that focus on enabling individual
agent behavior.


## What are some known limitations or issues?

* It's a new project, so keep that in mind in terms of
  completeness, but see [the issues
  page](https://github.com/operand/agency/issues) for what is currently planned,
  and the [Roadmap](#roadmap) below for the high level plan.

* This library makes use of threads for each individual agent. Multithreading
  is limited by [python's
  GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock), meaning that if you
  run a local model or other heavy computation in the same process as other
  agents, they may have to wait for their "turn". Note that I/O does not block,
  so networked backends or services will execute in parallel.
  
  For blocking processes, it's recommended to use the `AMQPSpace` class and run
  heavy computations in isolation to avoid blocking other agents.

* This API does not assume or enforce predefined roles like "user", "system",
  "assistant", etc. This is an intentional decision and is not likely to change.

  `agency` is intended to allow potentially large numbers of agents, systems,
  and people to come together. A small predefined set of roles gets in the way
  of representing many things generally. This is a core feature of `agency`:
  that all entities are treated the same and may be interacted with through
  common means.

  The lack of roles may require extra translation code when integrating with
  role based APIs. See the implementation of
  [`OpenAIFunctionAgent`](./examples/demo/agents/openai_function_agent.py) for
  an example.

* There is currently not much by way of storage support. That is mostly left up
  to you and I'd suggest looking at the many technologies that focus on that.
  The `Agent` class implements a simple `_message_log` array which you can make
  use of or overwrite to back it with longer term storage. More direct support
  for storage APIs will likely be considered in the future.

## Development Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:operand/agency.git
cd agency
poetry install
```


## Developing with the Demo Application

See [the demo directory](./examples/demo/) for instructions on how to run the
demo.

The demo application is written to showcase both native and AMQP spaces and
several agent examples. It can also be used for experimentation and development.

The application is configured to read the agency library source when running,
allowing changes to be tested manually.


## Test Suite

Ensure you have Docker installed. A small RabbitMQ container will be
automatically created.

You can run the test suite with:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```



# Roadmap

- **Multiprocess Support**:
An additional space type utilizing python multiprocessing, as another
parallelism option for single-host systems.

- **Multimodal Support**:
Image/audio transfer for use with multimodal models or other multimedia
services.

- **More Examples**:
More examples of integrations with popular AI libraries and tools such as
Langchain and oobabooga.
